# 📣 Social Media Manager

A cross-platform C++ application designed to create, schedule, and publish posts to multiple social media platforms.

## 🎬 auteur — the video editor agent

This repository also contains **[auteur](AUTEUR.md)**, an autonomous cinematic
editor that turns a folder of unsorted clips and a sentence of direction into a
finished, graded, beat-cut, sound-designed short film — ready to hand to the
publisher above.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo/make_footage.py ./rushes          # optional: synthesises test clips
python -m auteur edit ./rushes --prompt 'moody neon chase, 20 seconds, "AFTER DARK"'
```

It measures every clip frame by frame (motion, camera move, focus, exposure,
colour, subject position), derives a beat grid from the music, cuts to it, grades
and matches the shots, mixes the sound, and then **watches its own output back
and re-cuts what it got wrong**. Claude directs when an API key is present; a
full algorithmic director takes over when there isn't one, so the film always
gets made. See **[AUTEUR.md](AUTEUR.md)** for the full documentation.
